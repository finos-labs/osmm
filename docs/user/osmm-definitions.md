## Overview

There are three Dimensions:

1. Strategy
1. Management
1. Usage

Each dimension is made up of at least four Elements. Using the questionnaire, each Element (and therefore Dimension) is ranked according to its Stage of maturity. There are five Stages:

1. Ad-hoc
1. Aware
1. Managed
1. Engaged
1. Leading

At each stage, every element includes Attributes, Implications, and Activities. These details aid organizations on their path toward open source maturity and are a part of the model output.

-   **Attributes** — Elements by which an organization's specific activities can be measured or characterized. What is usually perceivable when an organization is in a particular stage?
-   **Implications** — Positive and negative measurable effects of the specific dimension attribute What are the benefits of being in this stage?
-   **Activities** — Typical actions to take to reach the next stage.

See the [OSMM Element Details document](./element-details.md) for more information about attributes, implications, and activities.

## Definitions

### Stages 

#### Ad hoc 

An organization at the ad hoc stage is characterized by little to no organized understanding of, and view on, open source. There is no governance nor controls of any kind in place, developers are downloading open source as they see fit. There is no insight into the amount, location or impact of open source from a development, legal, compliance, or security perspective.

-   Developers (consume, contribute, publication) - developers are finding and downloading open source at will and sharing with their peers with little thought to compliance and security
-   Legal (compliance, IP) - there is little knowledge or attention to open source by the legal team or any awareness of potential benefits
-   Security (risk mitigation) - same as above
-   Executive (strategy, planning, support) - same as above

#### Aware 

An organization is becoming aware of its usage of open source to some degree and typically legal and security/risk implement some form of strong controls. This state may also be referred to as "reactive".

-   Developers (consume, contribute, publication) - developers continue to try and download open source when they want, but may get frustrated by controls put in place.
-   Legal (compliance, IP) - legal begins to be aware that open source is permeating the company and react by creating a restrictive policy to control its use.
-   Security (risk mitigation) - same as above
-   Executive (strategy, planning, support) - typically leadership, at this point in time, thinks of open source as a nuisance and doesn't realize its strategic implications

#### Managed

An organization at the managed stage begins to think more thoughtfully about how they are going to realize some of the benefits of open source in a safe and compliant manner. They begin to plan and/or implement a policy and set of processes which support the use of open source rather than restrict it; at this point some organizations are thinking about an OSPO or have implemented a very basic one; the company may begin scanning code to some degree.

-   Developers (consume, contribute, publication) - developers are consuming more and more, but in a more organized fashion; they may also be contributing but not in a standardized manner.
-   Legal (compliance, IP) - legal has designated someone to manage the legal and compliance process.
-   Security (risk mitigation) - security requires the scanning of inbound and outbound code through a reactive process.
-   Executive (strategy, planning, support) - leadership is beginning to realize there are potential strategic benefits from open source either through being made aware of successes internally or external analyst and press, but usually this is about potential financial savings.

#### Engaged

An organization at this stage will have mostly fully implemente governance programs that support developers rather than restrict them they are contributing more actively back to communities and looking a even open sourcing some of their own software or participating i foundations, benefits are being seen across multiple dimensions and  strategy is begin fully formed to capture them programmatically fo innovation, developer recruitment, retention and increased productivity, they may be implementing inner source, they have a fully formed stack of collaboration tools in place.

-   Developers (consume, contribute, publication) - actively contributing with designated contributors and internal component maintainers, working on getting external maintainer status.
-   Legal (compliance, IP) - legal has fully educated open source experts --supporting organizational and developer engagement.
-   Security (risk mitigation) - same as above.
-   Executive (strategy, planning, support) - leadership provides the required resources and support to achieve their open source goals.

#### Leading 

A leading organization has a fully formed strategy, effective policies and processes and an open source program office (OSPO) that is helping the organization define and realize its open source goals and fully align them with overall corporate objectives, they are contributing to many projects and are fully engaged in one or more foundations, they are beginning to, or fully realizing the benefits of open source across strategic, technological, innovation and organizational domains, they have a fully implemented inner source and cultural transformation program driven by open source principals, they are public and open about their activities.

-   Developers (consume, contribute, publication) - multiple developers have reached committer/maintainer status in external projects, they are contributing actively to many projects and have open sourced at least one software asset.
-   Legal (compliance, IP) - members of the legal team are actively engaged in the community getting continuing education units (CEU) credits on open source topics, they may be training other lawyers and publishing articles
-   Security (risk mitigation) - active in the external security community speaking and publishing articles on open source.
-   Executive (strategy, planning, support) - same as above.

### Dimensions

#### Strategy

The act of creating and implementing a plan to realize the benefits of open source across all aspects: strategic, financial, technological, organizational

##### Elements

-   **Goals, objectives, resources** - creating multi-stage goals and objectives with associated KPIs facilitating an organization's upward growth through the stages to the optimal for that particular organization
-   **Corporate alignment** - that part of the strategy addressing the alignment and engagement of executives with the open source mission and eventual alignment of corporate and open source goals
-   **Community and ecosystem engagement** - part of the strategy that addresses how an organization will select which technologies, projects and foundations to engage in at what time with what resources to achieve which goals
-   **Operations** - the part of the strategy plan that details out the implementation plan, the resources required to achieve all aspects of the strategy plan
-   **Culture** - the identification of how open source can be used to support an existing culture or help with cultural transformation and should include inner source

#### Management

The processes and policies concerned with moving beyond simple awareness to actively directing engagement with open source components throughout their life cycle for reasons of risk, compliance and assurance, and security oversight and administration.

##### Elements

-   **Life-cycle management** - a policy, set of processes and tooling and automation implemented to manage open source components from ingestion, to usage to production to maintenance and support
-   **Risk management** -- a set of activities and processes to identify and mitigate potential control and reporting-related risks typically associated with highly regulated industries
-   **Compliance and assurance management** - the policy, processes and tooling which facilitate the effective licensing and IP compliance of open source components across the component life-cycle
-   **Security management** - the policy, processes and tooling which facilitates the secure use of open source across the component life-cycle

#### Usage

Practices related to inbound (internal usage) and outbound (contribution and publication) operations associated with open source projects and communities.

##### Elements

-   **Consumption** - how an organization identifies, qualifies, selects, acquires and uses open source components.
-   **Contribution** - how an organization plans, contributes and supports contributions to existing external open source communities.
-   **Publication** - how organizations plan, contribute and support internal code made open source and how it is published externally.
-   **InnerSource** - the way in which an organization implements a software development model based on open source best practices; collaboration, transparency and meritocracy, but keeping the resulting code internal to the corporate structure.
